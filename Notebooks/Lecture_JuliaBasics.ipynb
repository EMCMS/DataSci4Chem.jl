Variables with a local scope can, for example, only be seen within a function, while global variables can be seen through out the \"file\", but not within functions. That is why these variables need to be passed down to a function, for example the variable numbers in the case below. Same as to why we need to return res to be able to used is outside the function in the global scope, which is saved in variable out. When running the code below you will notice that println(res) will actually return an error, since to the global scope this variable is not defined and it only exists within the local scope of the function."
