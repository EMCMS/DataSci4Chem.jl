There are several matrix decomposition methods, depending on the applications. For example for solving systems of equations LU decomposition is employed. One of the highly relevant matrix decomposition approaches is singular value decomposition (SVD). The SVD decomposes a matrix X into the product is three matrices U_m times n, D_n times n, and V_n times n^T. The matrix U_m times n is the left singular matrix and it represents a rotation in the matrix space. The D_n times n is diagonal matrix and contains the singular values. Finally, V_n times n^T is called the right singular matrix and is associated with rotation. For more details of SVD please look at SVD course material.","category":"page"},{"location":"#Data-Analysis-and-Programming","page":"Home","title":"Data Analysis and Programming","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"The content of this page will be updated soon!!!

In this course, the students learn how to handle/model multi-dimensional data from simple visualization to machine learning based modeling and inference. The course contains 11 lectures from which 8 of them are tackling independent topics while the remaining are more generic. For 6 out of those 8, separate pages are created within this documentation. In future more topics will be added to the package and thus the documentation. This package utilizes wide range of other packages developed by others, as this is meant to facilitate the introduction of the students to programming and data science. The package is based on julia language.
