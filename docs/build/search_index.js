In this course, the students learn how to handle/model multi-dimensional data from simple visualization to machine learning based modeling and inference. The course contains 11 lectures from which 8 of them are tackling independent topics while the remaining are more generic. For 6 out of those 8, separate pages are created within this documentation. In future more topics will be added to the package and thus the documentation. This package utilizes wide range of other packages developed by others, as this is meant to facilitate the introduction of the students to programming and data science. The package is based on julia language.
